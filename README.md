# Programming in the C++ language
Welcome to the C++ programming language course! This repository serves as a continuation of my C programming course, which you can find [here](https://github.com/profjuvii/c-course). In this course, we will cover fundamental concepts and techniques of the C++ programming language. We'll explore various aspects of the language, ranging from basic data types to object-oriented programming and beyond.

## Schedule of topics
Below is the schedule of topics covered in this course:
